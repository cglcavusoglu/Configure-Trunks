# Configure-Trunks-VlAN-Communication
Configuring Trunks for VLAN Communication
This repository presents a network simulation project using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on the configuration of trunks for VLAN communication. Trunk configuration allows multiple VLANs to communicate over a single physical connection, improving network efficiency and segmentation. Through the simulation, the project demonstrates the process of assigning appropriate VLAN tagging and trunk mode to switch interfaces.
